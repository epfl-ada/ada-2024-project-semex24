    "Our analysis explores the relationship between cinema, major historical events, and seasonal trends, examining how genres, themes, and revenues in movies evolve in response to societal shifts and audience preferences. Through this project, we aim to reveal how cinema evolves as a cultural medium, responding dynamically to both historical events and seasonal influences. By mapping patterns over time, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of how films resonate with audiences during different historical and cultural contexts, highlighting cinema’s role as both a reflection and an influencer of society."

    "We are utilizing two primary datasets in this project: the *CMU* dataset and the *TMDB Movies Dataset* from Kaggle. The *CMU* dataset serves as our foundational source, providing detailed information on genres, release dates, and thematic elements, which are essential for analyzing the relationship between movies, historical events, and seasonal patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complement the *CMU * dataset, we incorporated the *TMDB Movies Dataset*, a comprehensive movie database that includes additional features such as ratings, revenue, and popularity scores. Integrating this dataset adds depth to our analysis, especially by enriching financial insights and addressing missing values within the *CMU s* dataset. This combined approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both datasets, ensuring a more robust and accurate exploration of cinema’s evolution over time.\n"
